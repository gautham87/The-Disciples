# The-Disciples

# Project Description

We built a voice recognition tool to take in voice input and execute actions such as, open spotify, make a to do list, or calendar actions. We used pyaudio to convert voice to text and integrated spotify using spotify apis. tkinter was used to take in a username and password so a profile can be setup for each independent user. This program will be useful for hands-free operations or disabled patients who are unable to interact with HID (Human Peripheral) devices.

# Future potential and target audience

This project can be expanded on by adding in more features such as giving weather information, controling appliances such as fans, lights, etc. It can used by the general public as it makes interactions with everyday applications more seameless. If not for the general public, it can be used by disabled patients who may have difficulty using conventional interactive devices such as touch screens or keyboards.
