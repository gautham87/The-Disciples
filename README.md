# The-Disciples

# Project Description

We built a voice recognition tool to take in voice input and execute actions such as, open spotify, make a to do list, or calendar actions. We used pyaudio to convert voice to text and integrated spotify using spotify apis. tkinter was used to take in a username and password so a profile can be setup for each independent user. This program will be useful for hands-free operations or disabled patients who are unable to interact with HID (Human Peripheral) devices.
